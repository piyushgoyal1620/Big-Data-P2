# Uber_P2

In this project we grab the real time data from Kaggle and perform various operation on this data, and we separate it  into 3 different types of data so it will more effectively show the details. This contains all records of real time Uber rides.
After thinking 360 degrees we partitioned this data into 3 DataSets(Admin, Passesnger, Rider).
We were done this project over the integration with PySpark with Jupyter Notebook and using databricks cloud resources and perform all queries by using PySpark and SparkSQL also.
So we have 2 different types of syntaxes here.
